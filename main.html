	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its task. It is a crucial aspect of algorithm analysis as it helps in understanding how the execution time of an algorithm grows with the input size. Efficient algorithms are designed to have low time complexity, meaning they can handle large amounts of data quickly and effectively.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses based on the input size. In the context of space complexity analysis, algorithms are evaluated in terms of their memory usage. One common notation used to describe space complexity is <b>Big O notation (O(n))</b>, where 'n' represents the size of the input. Understanding space complexity is essential in optimizing algorithms for memory usage, especially in applications where memory resources are limited.</p>
